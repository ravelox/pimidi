.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR raveloxmidi
provides a RTP MIDI proxy to send MIDI NoteOn, NoteOff, ControlChange and ProgramChange events to a remote MIDI device.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
Display current version number and exit.
.TP
.B -c \fIfilename\fP
Name of configuration file to use. If no configuration file is provided, some defaults are assumed. See below for details.
.TP
.B -d
Run in debug mode. This will provide debug-level output to either stdout or the configured log file.
.TP
.B -i
Run in info mode. This will provide info-level output to either stdout or the configured log file.
.TP
.B -N
Do not run as a daemon.
.TP
.B -P \fIpidfile\fP
File to store the pid of the running process.
.br
Default is \fBraveloxmidi.pid \fP in the current directory.
.TP
.B -R
Enable readonly mode. This doesn't write anything to disk.
.TP
.B -h
Display help information including default values for some parameters.
.TP
.B -C
Display the current config to stderr
.TP
.B -b \fIbind_address\fP
Set the network address to bind to. See \fBnetwork.bind_address\fP
.SH NOTES
The available options for the configuration file are listed below. Some parameters are marked as multi-value which means you can either specify them as a single value or with numerical index as a suffix.
For example, if there is a parameter called \fBalsa.output_device\fP you can use either:
.LP
alsa.output_device = device_name
.LP
or
.LP
alsa.output_device.0 = first_device
.br
alsa.output_device.1 = second_device
.LP
A multi-value configuration option \fBmust\fP start at index 0 and parsing will stop when there is a break in the sequence. That is, if the values are 0,1,3,4,5 then \fBonly\fP 0 and 1 will be detected.
.LP
The available options are:
.TP
.B network.bind_address
IP address that raveloxmidi listens on. This can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
.br
Default is 0.0.0.0 ( meaning all IPv4 interfaces ). IPv6 equivalent is ::
.br
This \fBmust\fP be set in the configuration file for raveloxmidi to run.
.TP
.B network.control.port
Main RTP MIDI listening port for new connections and shutdowns. Used in the Avahi definition for the RTP MIDI service.
.br
Default is 5004.
.TP
.B network.data.port
Listening port for all other data in the conversation.
.br
Default is 5005.
.TP
.B network.local.port
Local listening port for accepting MIDI events.
.br
Default is 5006.
.TP
.B service.ipv4
Indicate whether Avahi service should use IPv4 addresses.
.br
Default is yes.
.TP
.B service.ipv6
Indicate whether Avahi service should use IPv6 addressed.
.br
Default is no.
.TP
.B network.max_connections
Maximum number of incoming connections that can be stored.
.br
Default is 8.
.TP
.B service.name
Name used in the Avahi definition for the RTP MIDI service.
.br
Default is \fBraveloxmidi\fP.
.TP
.B remote.connect
Name of remote service to connect to.
.br
The value can be one of two formats:
.br
To connect to a Bonjour-advertised service, use the format:
.br
\fBremote.connect = service\fP
.br
To connect directly to a server/port, use the format:
.br
\fBremote.connect = [address]:port\fP
.br
A port number \fBmust\fP be specified if making a direct connection.
.TP
.B remote.use_control_for_ck
Indicates whether CK (AppleMIDI Feedback) messages are sent to the a remote connection using the control port.
.br
Default is yes
.TP
.B network.socket_timeout
Polling timeout for the listening sockets.
.br
Default is 30 seconds.
.TP
.B discover.timeout
Length of time in seconds to wait for new remote services to be seen.
.br
Default is 5 seconds.
.TP
.B run_as_daemon
Specifies that raveloxmidi should run in the background.
.br
Default is no.
.TP
.B
daemon.pid_file
If raveloxmidi is run in the background. The pid for the process is written to this file.
.br
Default is \fBraveloxmidi.pid\fP.
.TP
.B
logging.enabled
Set to yes to write output to a log file. Set to no to disable.
.br
Default is yes.
.TP
.B
logging.log_file
Name of file to write logging to.
.br
Default is \fBstderr\fP.
.TP
.B
logging.log_level
Threshold for log events. Acceptable values are \fBdebug\fP , \fBinfo\fP , \fBnormal\fP , \fBwarning\fP and \fBerror\fP.
.br
Default is normal.
.TP
.B
logging.hex_dump
Set to yes to write hex dump of data buffers to log file. This can slow down processing for large buffers if enabled.
.br
Default is no
.TP
.B
security.check
If set to yes, it is not possible to write the daemon pid to a file with executable permissions.
.br
Default is yes.
.TP
.B
inbound_midi
Name of file to write inbound MIDI events to. This file is governed by the security check option.
.br
Default is \fB/dev/sequencer\fP.
.TP
.B
file_mode
File permissions on the inbound_midi file if it needs to be created. Specify as Unix octal permissions. 
.br

.br
This is a multi-value configuration option. See the \fBNOTES\fP section above for how to specify multiple values.
.TP
.B alsa.input_device
Name of the rawmidi ALSA device to read MIDI events from.
.br
This is a multi-value configuration option. See the \fBNOTES\fP section above for how to specify multiple values.
.TP 
.B alsa.input_buffer_size
Size of the buffer to use for reading data from the input device.
.br
Default is 4096. Maximum is 65535.
.TP 
.B alsa.writeback
If a MIDI command is received from an inbound ALSA device, this option controls whether that event is written to an ALSA output device if it has the same level number.
.br
See also \fBalsa.writeback.level\fP.
.br
This is a yes/no option. Default is no.
.TP 
.B alsa.writeback.level
Indicates how granular to make the alsa.writeback check.

.SH DEBUGGING
For debugging, additional logging can be generated for each memory allocation and release. An environment variable \fBRAVELOXMIDI_MEM_FILE\fP can be set to the name of a file to log the extra information into. This should only be enabled on request.
